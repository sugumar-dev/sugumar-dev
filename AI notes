popular tools in NLP

There are several popular NLP libraries that you can use in Python. Here are some of them:

spaCy: A free, open-source library for NLP in Python and Cython. It is designed to be used in production environments and comes with pre-trained pipelines for tokenization, named entity recognition, text classification, and more. It also supports training custom models 1.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, semantic reasoning, and wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries 2.

Hugging Face Transformers: A Python library that provides state-of-the-art general-purpose architectures for natural language understanding and generation. It includes pre-trained models for a wide range of NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and language translation 1.

Gensim: A Python library for topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval with large corpora. It has efficient multicore implementations of popular algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI/SVD), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Random Projections (RP), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), or word2vec deep learning 1.

AllenNLP: A Python library for building deep learning models for NLP. It provides a suite of pre-built models for tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling, as well as tools for building custom models 3.

Fairseq: A sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language modeling, and other text generation tasks. It provides reference implementations of various sequence modeling papers 1.

Jina: A neural search framework to build state-of-the-art and scalable neural search applications in minutes. Jina allows building solutions for indexing, querying, understanding multi-/cross-modal data such as video, image, text, audio, source code, PDF 1.

TextBlob: A Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more 3.

CoreNLP: A Java-based NLP toolkit developed by Stanford University. It provides a wide range of tools for NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more 2.

Pattern: A web mining module for Python. It has tools for natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis, and visualization 1.
